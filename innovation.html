            <p>swivel dual t display</p>
            <pre>                                       LG Wing-2020 tries to break the walls of monotony with its unique swivel T design.<br>
    It offers a unique way of multitasking with the two displays both of which are OLED screens. The gimbal mode records ultra-stable footage <br>
    and will definitely be appreciated by people who are more into mobile videography. The main camera still needs some improvement and a <br>
    telephoto lens would be much appreciated. LG Wingâ€™s displays implement the standard 60Hz refresh rate.</pre>

    It was curved along its length so that it would fit comfortably along your face as you held it up for phone calls. It was a rather large phablet phone <br>
    with a six-inch display, which was very large for this time period. which had a smaller form factor and the great S Pen experience. Today we see <br>
    foldable phones with flexible displays and can thank LG for leading the way.</pre>

            <pre>                                Nowadays all smartphones are given with ultra wide cameras but prior the LG provided an ultra-wide rear camera on the back of LG-G5.<br>
LG also had a front-facing ultra-wide camera on the LG-V10, which was one of the first times we saw two cameras on the front of a smartphone.</pre>

                <pre>
                                              LG Prada was the first capacitive touchscreen phone and an inspiration for the iPhone.<br>
    When people think of capacitive touchscreen displays on phones, the default belief is that Apple was the first to launch with this technology in the <br>
    original iPhone. However, LG beat Apple to the punch with the LG Prada that was launched in 2006.The LG Prada had a 3-inch capacitive display with <br>
    a 400x240 pixel resolution. It sported a pretty decent camera, but was priced at $849 in the US so it wasn't that popular.

                <pre>                                While others were looking at foldable phones, LG offered a simple solution with its LG Dual Screen cover that offered a big duplicate <br>
  display for a much more affordable price. It first launched the LG G8X with this option and then we saw the V50 and V60. The LG Velvet also supported <br>
  the Dual Screen cover. The beauty of this solution was that you could use the dual-display when needed or pop out the phone and use it as a standard <br>
  phone with ease. The dual display was well supported and the LG V60 and V50 offered the ultimate experience with extensive support for stylus use. <br>
  I will continue to use the LG V60 for years because it truly is one of the best smartphones today.</pre>

                <pre>
                                        The idea of a modular smartphone where you simply slide off various accessories for enhanced functionality sounded good at<br>
    first when LG launched the LG G5. However, modules never showed up so you were limited to just a removable battery, digital-to-analog converter,<br>
    and a camera grip. The "LG Friends" never showed up to the party and the G5 didn't do well in the market.
